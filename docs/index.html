	<h1>Unblurring images of text with neural networks</h1>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Sharpening images of text is easy for humans. Take for example the following photo:</p>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="introtrain.png" />
	<p>Blurred image</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>It is easy for anyone to output the following photo base on the former:</p>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="introlabel.png" />
	<p>The original image</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Now we are lazy and don&#39;t want to do this over and over so we should 
	automate the unblurring with neural networks!</p>
	
	<h2>Development</h2>
	
	<p>Training data for this ploblem is eazy to generate.
	A simple python script utilizing the PIL library
	is all it takes to generate simple images of blurred text and their corresponding labels
	(Of course it&#39;s not as easy to get real photos of blurred text and their
	unblurred conterparts, the generated images will have to do).</p>

	<div class="figure">
		<p>
			<img src="validation_1_train5.png" alt=""/>
			<img src="validation_1_train8.png" alt=""/>
			<img src="validation_1_train9.png" alt=""/>
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="validation_1_label5.png" alt=""/>
			<img src="validation_1_label8.png" alt=""/>
			<img src="validation_1_label9.png" alt=""/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples from the training set
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Formally, if we
	let \(F_\theta\) be the neural network which unblurrs images,
	\(Y_1,Y_2,&hellip;,Y_n\) be images and \(X_1,X_2,&hellip;,X_n\) their blurred conterparts,
	then we want to find parameters \(\theta\) for the neural net which satisfy:
	\[
	    \theta = argmin_{\gamma} \frac{1}{n} \sum_i (Y_i - F_\gamma(X_i))^2
	\]
	This is simply the mean squared error per pixel between the original image and
	the unblurred image.  
	To solve this problem a few types of architectures were tried.
	All of them, however, were some form of convolutional neural network.</p>
	
	<p>One architecture that was expected to work well was a few convolution layers 
	which had the same output dimensions as the input dimension, aside for the number
	of channels. This was not the case. After training this model the following
	inputs and outputs were obtained:</p>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="identity.png" />
	<p>Left column: The blurred image, Middle column: The original image, Right column: The outputted image</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Clearly the neural network has simply learned the identity function. This is a 
	local minima of the cost function and a pretty strong one.
	Changing the number of
	layers, changing the activation fuctions, changing the cost function and 
	changing the number of intermediate channels had no effect on what the net converged to,
	the local mimima could not be avoided this way.
	Therefore a redesign was needed.</p>
	
	<p>Instead of forcing the output dimensions of the convolutions to be the same
	for all the layers, the convolution layers are allowed to shrink the
	image. However, to calculate the per pixel mean squared error the output image 
	needs to have the same dimension 
	as the input image. Therefore deconvolutional layers were needed to 
	enlarge the image again.</p>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="architecture.png" />
	<p>The neural network architecture</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>With this archetecture the network was able to fit the data better. </p>


	<h2>Training</h2>

	<p>Batch gradient descent was used to training the neural net. The batch size was 8
	and the learning rate was set to 0.001.</p>

	<div class="figure">
	<img src="trainplot.png" />
	<p>The cost while training</p>
	</div>

	<p>Finding a good learning rate for training turned out to be challanging.
	The network would only learn reasonably fast for a learning rate which was
	close to a learning rate which made the training diverge. 
	A novel method was used to find a good learning rate: simply print out a parameter in 
	the neural network (one parameter was used here) and print it out after each iteration.
	If it isn&#39;t changing: increase the learning rate. If it&#39;s changing: if it gets large 
	fast then divergence is happening, otherwise this learning rate should be choosen.
	This method is of course really simple but yielded great results for this work.</p>

	<p>After choosing the learning rate the network started to fit the training data. First it learned about the
	black parts around the square, then about coloring the square with the correct color.
	Then slowly but surely the network learned to output the letters unblurred.</p>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="iter500.png" />
	<p>500 iterations</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="iter3000.png" />
	<p>3000 iterations</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="figure">
	<img src="iter22000.png" />
	<p>22000 iterations</p>
	</div>

	<p>The following images are from the validation set and show the effectiveness of the neural net</p>

	<h2>What I learned</h2>
	
	<p>This project was a great learning experience, I learned that:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Choosing the learning rate can mean the difference between a good result an no result at all.</li>
	<li>Choosing the correct architecture is important in avoiding poor local mimimas.</li>
	<li>Tensorflow is great.</li>
	</ul>
